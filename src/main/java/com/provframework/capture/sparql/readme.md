# SPARQL

## Description
This folder contains all the code needed to use SPARQL. Specifically there is a database driver and a language class. The language class builds the bundle insert statement. The driver connects to a remote graph database using the Eclipse Foundation RDF4J library. Currently the default configuration is for a RDF4J Server docker container running on a local machine.
